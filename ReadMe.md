# Setup
  Recursively clone the repo:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/joksim/OpenGLPrj.git
    

  If you are using an IDE that supports CMake builds (QtCreator, Visual Studio), open the cloned folder as project.

  Alternatevly project files can be generated using the following steps:

  If using cmd/powershell/terminal:
  - Create a folder for the project build (e.g. build).
  - Using CMake generate the specified project files into the build directory:

      cd build
      cmake ../OpenGLPrj/

    Open the project files in the spedified IDE (Visual Studio, QtCreator, ...)
